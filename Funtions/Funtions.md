Spivak 'Calculus' part 2 - Foundations
===================
###A brief overview of the main ideas


##1. Functions
Spivak starts of with what he calls the provisional definition of a funciton:
>A function is a rule which assigns, to each of certain real numbers, some other real number.

This is to say that a function takes some numbers, does something to them and returns the results.


----------


Perhaps the simplest function is a constant one, so let's take a look:
$$
f(x) = c
$$
If we plug in any natural number into our function ***f***, we should, without any problems, get the value ***c***. So we can say that for all ***x*** that is a natural number, ***f(x)*** will be equal to ***c***:
$$
\forall x\in\mathbb N, f(x) = c
$$
Now, our function would work not only for natural numbers, but for all numbers, as seen in the table below. So why is it important to specify such a thing?

x    | f(x)
-------- | ---
0|**c**
1|**c**
2|**c**
2.5|**c**
-2|**c**
j|**c**

Because, some functions don't '*work*' for all numbers!


----------
If you draw a graph of a function (which is the visual representation of it), you get a line (unless our function takes more than one parameter).
Now what would it mean for a function if its graph had a hole in it?
