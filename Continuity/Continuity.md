#Continuity

Continuity of a function can, on the basic level, be understood quite easily:
>Something is continuous if it doesn't have any holes or breaks.
----------
It can sometimes be hard to check whether a certain function is continuous on it's whole domain, so we should first look at individual points on its graph.

We can say that a function is continuous at a single point if it gives almost the same result for the points a tiny bit away.
So, if **f(2)** = 4, **f(1.9998)** should almost be equal to 2, say **3.9992**, and **f(2.0001)** = 4.0004

This means that the limit of **f** at some point is equal to the value of that function at that point, or formally:
>The function **f** is continnons at **a** if:
$$
\lim_{x \to a} f (x) = f (a)
$$
